# Overview
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) offer a rich dataset of user activity at Points-of-Interest (POIs), making next POI recommendation a key task. Traditional algorithms face challenges due to broad searching scopes, affecting recommendation accuracy. Users tend to visit nearby POIs and show temporal concentration in their activities, reflecting personalized spatio-temporal clustering. However, individual user data may be insufficient to capture these clustering effects for personalized recommendations. In this paper, we propose an integrated Personalized Spatio-Temporal Clustering Model (iPCM) for next POI recommendation. The model learns this kind of personalized spatio-temporal clustering effect by using global historical trajectory data in conjunction with user feature embeddings. It integrates the features of personalized spatio-temporal clustering with the user’s trajectory, and completes the user’s POI recommendation through a Transformer encoding and MLP decoding. To enhance the accuracy of predictions, we add a module of probability adjustment. The experimental results on multiple datasets show that with the help of personalized spatio-temporal clustering, the proposed iPCM is superior to existing methods in various evaluation metrics.
